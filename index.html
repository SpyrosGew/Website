        <h3>Some things about me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I am currently in the second year of university in greece </li>
            <li> I choose this path because from a small age I was intrigued by the way computers work. How
                could a piece of glass show all this information? How could I possibly be able to see the face 
                of a relative and hear his voice when he lives miles away? After destroying a few laptops at age 
                12 I slowly started to figure it out.</li>
            <li> I am hungry for knowledge. I always want to explore new technologies and use more tools, I don't aspire
                to be a web developer but I am confident I can create a simple website to showcase my projects.
            </li>
            <li> I love working in team environments. It's the extra motivation I need for continuing and not fall behind. 
                because the last thing I want is to see the faces of people I have let down.
            </li>
            <li> I have good familiarity with Java C and python, working in vscode and Intelj IDEs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Some Personal Projects </h2>
        As good as school projects are, they are outdated. So in order to stay up to date and use new technologies
        I felt the need to do some work in the background.
