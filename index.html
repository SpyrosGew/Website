            <ul>
                <li> I am currently in the second year of university in greece </li>
                <li> I choose this path because from a small age I was intrigued by the way computers work. How
                    could a piece of glass show all this information? How could I possibly be able to see the face 
                    of a relative and hear his voice when he lives miles away? After destroying a few laptops at age 
                    12 I slowly started to figure it out.</li>
                <li> I am hungry for knowledge. I always want to explore new technologies and use more tools, I don't aspire
                    to be a web developer but I am confident I can create a simple website to showcase my projects.
                </li>
                <li> I love working in team environments. It's the extra motivation I need for continuing and not fall behind. 
                    because the last thing I want is to see the faces of people I have let down.
                </li>
                <li> I have good familiarity with Java C and python, working in vscode and Intelj IDEs</li>

            As good as school projects are, they are outdated. So in order to stay up to date and use new technologies
            I felt the need to do some work in the background.

        Even if they are outdated, even if they do not probably matter. Its my page ill show them :)
        <h4> Calendar App made in Java </h4>
        A cool calendar app that was for OOP2 project. Basically you load an ics file
        <a target="_blank" href="https://icalendar.org/">iCalendar.org</a> and you can create different 
        kinds of appointments you have to do. See the project at
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/George-oikonomou/projectForJava2"> CalendarApp</a>.
        It was the first Project that was actually something usable, and was also a team effort which lead to
        learning some core tools like github.
